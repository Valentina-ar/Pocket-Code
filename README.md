# Pocket-Code
A small piano app that I created in Pocket Code.
It's called **Mini Piano!**
***
If you want to play the app you need to download first the **Pocket Code** app from playstore.
> You can either search **Mini piano!** on "Catrobat Community" and download it, 

> Or you can download the catrobat file on your phone or an emulator, import it to the *Pocket Code* app and play piano!
